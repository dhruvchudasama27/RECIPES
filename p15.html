                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the mashed vegetables, breadcrumbs, chopped onions, minced garlic, cumin powder, coriander powder, paprika or chili powder, salt, and black pepper.</li>

                    <li>Mix everything together until well combined. The mixture should hold its shape when you form it into patties. If it's too wet, you can add more breadcrumbs, and if it's too dry, you can add a bit of water.</li>

                    <li>Divide the mixture into equal portions and shape them into patties. You can make them as thick or as thin as you prefer.</li>

                    <li>Heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the vegetable patties and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crispy.</li>

                    <li>Remove the patties from the pan and place them on paper towels to drain any excess oil.</li>

                    <li>Slice the burger buns in half and lightly toast them in the same pan or a toaster until they are slightly crispy and golden.</li>

                    <li>To assemble the burger, start with the bottom half of the bun. Place a lettuce leaf, followed by a vegetable patty.</li>

                    <li>Add sliced tomatoes, onions, and pickles on top of the patty.</li>

                    <li>Spread ketchup, mayonnaise, or your preferred condiments on the top half of the bun.</li>

                    <li>Place the top bun over the condiments to complete the burger.</li>
