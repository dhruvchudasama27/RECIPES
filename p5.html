                <ol>
                    <li>If using fresh corn, remove the kernels from the cob. If using frozen or canned corn, drain and
                        rinse them.</li>

                    <li>In a large pot, melt the butter or heat the oil over medium heat.</li>

                    <li>Add the chopped onion, minced garlic, diced carrot, and celery (if using) to the pot. Sauté the
                        vegetables until they are soft and the onion is translucent.</li>

                    <li>Add the sweet corn kernels to the pot and sauté for a few more minutes, allowing them to cook
                        slightly.</li>

                    <li>Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, and bring the mixture to a boil. Once it's boiling,
                        reduce the heat to a simmer.</li>

                    <li>Let the soup simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and flavors have
                        melded together.</li>

                    <li>Using an immersion blender or a regular blender, carefully blend the soup until it's smooth. If
                        using a regular blender, allow the soup to cool a bit before blending, and then reheat it
                        afterward.</li>

                    <li>Return the blended soup to the pot, and stir in the milk or heavy cream. Heat the soup gently
                        over low to medium heat, stirring occasionally. Be careful not to let it boil after adding the
                        dairy to prevent curdling.</li>

                    <li>Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste. Start with a little salt and pepper and adjust
                        according to your preference.</li>

                    <li>Once the soup is heated through and well-mixed, it's ready to serve.</li>

                    <li>Ladle the sweet corn soup into individual serving bowls.</li>

                    <li>Garnish each bowl with chopped fresh herbs, such as parsley or chives. This adds both flavor and
                        a pop of color to the soup.</li>

                    <li>Serve the sweet corn soup warm and enjoy its comforting flavors!</li>
