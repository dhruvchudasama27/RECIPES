                    <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>

                    <li>Pinch of salt</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>

                    <li>Grease the insides of 4-6 ramekins with butter, then dust them with cocoa powder. This will help
                        the cakes release easily after baking.</li>

                    <li>In a microwave-safe bowl or using a double boiler, melt the butter and chocolate together. If
                        using the microwave, heat in short intervals, stirring between each interval, until the mixture
                        is smooth and fully melted. Let it cool slightly.</li>

                    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, egg yolks, and powdered sugar together until well combined.
                    </li>

                    <li>Slowly whisk the melted chocolate and butter mixture into the egg and sugar mixture until
                        smooth.</li>

                    <li>Add the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt, and mix well.</li>

                    <li>Gently fold in the all-purpose flour until no streaks remain. Be careful not to overmix; you
                        want a smooth batter.</li>

                    <li>Divide the batter evenly among the prepared ramekins, filling each about 3/4 full.</li>

                    <li>Place the ramekins on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes. The
                        edges of the cakes should be set, but the centers should still be slightly jiggly.</li>

                    <li>Carefully remove the ramekins from the oven and let them sit for about 1-2 minutes. This allows
                        the cakes to cool slightly and makes them easier to handle.</li>
