                <ol>
                    <li>Making the Rasgulla (Cottage Cheese Balls):</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li type="square"> In a large heavy-bottomed pan, bring 1 liter of milk to a boil. Once it
                            starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and add 2 tablespoons of lemon juice or vinegar. Stir
                            continuously until the milk curdles and the whey separates. If it doesn't curdle completely,
                            you can add a little more lemon juice or vinegar.</li>
                        <li type="square">Once the milk has completely curdled, remove it from the heat. Place a muslin
                            cloth or cheesecloth over a large strainer and strain the curdled milk. Collect the whey in
                            a separate bowl; this can be used for other purposes.</li>
                        <li type="square">Rinse the chenna (paneer) under cold water to remove any traces of lemon juice
                            or vinegar. Squeeze out the excess water by tying the cloth and hanging it for about 30
                            minutes to drain.</li>
                        <li type="square">After 30 minutes, transfer the drained chenna to a clean surface. Add
                            semolina, cardamom powder, and a pinch of baking soda. Knead the mixture well until it
                            becomes smooth and starts leaving the sides of your hand.</li>
                        <li type="square">Divide the mixture into small portions and shape them into small balls. Make
                            sure there are no cracks in the balls.</li>
                        <li type="square">In a separate pot, combine 1 cup of sugar and 4 cups of water. Bring it to a
                            boil to make a sugar syrup.</li>
                        <li type="square">Add the chenna balls to the boiling sugar syrup. Cover and cook for about
                            20-25 minutes on medium heat. The balls will double in size and become spongy. They are
                            ready when they start floating on the surface.</li>
                        <li type="square">Turn off the heat and let the rasgullas cool down in the sugar syrup. They
                            will absorb the syrup and become sweet.</li>
                    </ul>
                        <li>Preparing the Ras (Sweetened Milk Syrup):</li>
                    <ul>
                            <li type="square">In a separate wide pan, bring 4 cups of milk to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the milk reduces to about half its original quantity.</li>
                            <li type="square">Add sugar, saffron strands (if using), and cardamom powder to the reduced milk. Stir well and simmer for another 5-7 minutes until the sugar dissolves completely.</li>

                    </ul>
                        <li>Assembling Ras Malai:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li type="square">Take the rasgullas out of the sugar syrup and gently press each one between your palms to remove excess syrup.</li>
                            <li type="square">Place the rasgullas in the sweetened milk (ras) and let them soak for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator. You can garnish with chopped pistachios and almonds.</li>
                            <li type="square">Serve chilled and enjoy your homemade Ras Malai!</li>
