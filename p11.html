                <ol>
                    <li>For Chole (Chickpea Curry):</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li type="square">Drain and rinse the soaked chickpeas. In a pressure cooker or a large pot,
                            cook the chickpeas with enough water and a pinch of salt until they are tender. If using a
                            pressure cooker, it may take about 2-3 whistles, or if using a pot, it may take about 45
                            minutes to 1 hour. Drain and set aside.</li>
                        <li type="square">Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.
                        </li>
                        <li type="square">Add bay leaf, cinnamon stick, cloves, and cardamom pods. Sauté for a minute or
                            until they release their aroma.</li>
                        <li type="square">Add chopped onions and sauté until they become golden brown.</li>
                        <li type="square">Add minced garlic, grated ginger, and green chilies. Sauté for a couple of
                            minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>
                        <li type="square">Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and the oil starts to
                            separate.</li>
                        <li type="square">Add coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well
                            and cook for a few more minutes.</li>
                        <li type="square">Add the cooked chickpeas and about 1-1.5 cups of water. Simmer for 10-15
                            minutes until the curry thickens and the flavors meld together.</li>
                        <li type="square">Sprinkle garam masala and stir well. Cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
                        <li type="square">Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and set aside.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>For Bhature (Fried Bread):</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li type="square">In a mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour, semolina, yogurt, sugar, baking
                            powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix well.</li>
                        <li type="square">Add water gradually and knead the mixture into a smooth, pliable dough. The
                            dough should be soft but not sticky. Cover it with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 2
                            hours.</li>
                        <li type="square">After resting, divide the dough into small, golf ball-sized portions and roll
                            them into smooth balls.</li>
                        <li type="square">Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium-high heat.</li>
                        <li type="square">Roll each dough ball into a thin circle using a rolling pin. The bhature
                            should be about 6-7 inches in diameter.</li>
                        <li type="square">Carefully slide the rolled bhature into the hot oil. Press gently with a
                            spatula to puff them up. Fry until they turn golden brown on both sides, flipping as needed.
                        </li>
                        <li type="square">Remove the bhature from the oil and drain them on paper towels.</li>

                    </ul>
